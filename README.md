# EV_Data_Analysis_Project_Python
## Project Overview<br>
 In this project, you will analyze a dataset related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dataset contains
 various features such as electric range, energy consumption, price, and other relevant
 attributes. Your goal is to conduct a thorough analysis to uncover meaningful insights, tell a
 compelling story, conduct hypothesis testing and provide actionable recommendations based on
 the data.<br>
 ## Dataset: FEV-data-Excel.xlsx<br>
 ## Dataset Overview<br>
 Car full name: The full name or designation of the vehicle, often combining make, model, and
 variant.<br>
 Make: The brand or manufacturer of the car.<br>
 Model: The specific model or version of the car.<br>
 Minimal price (gross) [PLN]: The minimum retail price of the car, in Polish złoty (PLN).<br>
 Engine power [KM]: The car's engine power, measured in horsepower (KM in Polish).<br>
 Maximum torque [Nm]: The peak torque the engine can produce, measured in Newton-meters
 (Nm).<br>
 Type of brakes: The braking system used, such as disc or drum brakes.<br>
 Drive type: The drivetrain configuration, like FWD (front-wheel drive), RWD (rear-wheel drive),
 or AWD (all-wheel drive).<br>
 Battery capacity [kWh]: Total energy capacity of the car’s battery, measured in kilowatt-hours
 (kWh).<br>
 Range (WLTP) [km]: Estimated driving range on a full charge under WLTP standards, in
 kilometers.<br>
 Wheelbase [cm]: The distance between the front and rear axles, in centimeters.<br>
 Length [cm]: The overall length of the car, in centimeters.<br>
 Width [cm]: The car’s width, in centimeters.<br>
Height [cm]: The car’s height, in centimeters.<br>
 Minimal empty weight [kg]: The car’s minimum weight when empty, measured in kilograms.<br>
 Permissible gross weight [kg]: Maximum legally allowed weight, including passengers and
 cargo, in kilograms.<br>
 Maximum load capacity [kg]: The maximum weight the car can carry, in kilograms.<br>
 Number of seats: The number of passenger seats in the car.<br>
 Number of doors: The number of doors on the car.<br>
 Tire size [in]: The tire size, measured in inches.<br>
 Maximum speed [kph]: The top speed of the car, in kilometers per hour.<br>
 Boot capacity (VDA) [l]: Trunk or cargo space capacity, measured in liters according to VDA
 standards.<br>
 Acceleration 0-100 kph [s]: Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour, in
 seconds.<br>
 Maximum DCcharging power [kW]: The highest charging power supported when using a DC
 fast charger, in kilowatts (kW).<br>
 Mean- Energy consumption [kWh/100 km]: Average energy consumption per 100 kilometers,
 in kilowatt-hours (kWh).<br>
## Task 1: A customer has a budget of 350,000 PLN and wants an EV with a minimum range of 400 km.
## Task 2: Unusually high or low energy consumption.
## Task 3: Relationship between battery capacity and range.
## Task 4: Build an EV recommendation class.
## Task 5: Inferential Statistics– Hypothesis Testing.
